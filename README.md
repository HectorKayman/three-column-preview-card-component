- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to match the asked requirements and the provided design much more accurately, buy the use of both Flexbox and Grid, used variables to avoid code duplication. Overall, it was a simple project and the completion time was faster too, compared to the previous challenges I had completed.
